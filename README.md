# NLP_521
Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python notebooks and scripts designed to work with embeddings, visualization, and data classification in machine learning projects. Below is a brief explanation of each file and its function within the project.

Python Notebooks
pointwise_embeddings.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates how to generate pointwise embeddings using specific machine learning models. It includes methods for training and evaluating the embeddings on sample data.

window_embeddings.ipynb
Focuses on creating window-based embeddings, which are useful in tasks that require understanding the context within a sliding window over the data.

CS521.ipynb
Contains coursework, examples, or demonstrations related to the CS521 course, possibly focusing on advanced machine learning techniques or assignments.
Python Scripts

training_helpers.py
Provides helper functions to facilitate the training process of machine learning models. This might include batch generation, training loop management, and metrics calculation.

visualisation_functions.py
Includes functions to visualize data and model outputs, which are essential for interpreting the model's performance and the characteristics of the data.

window_context.py
A script for managing and manipulating data within a window context, useful for models that depend on a fixed-size input window for making predictions.

returns_data_class.py
Defines a class or several functions for handling return data in financial models or similar applications, including data preprocessing and normalization.

sector_classification.py
Implements methods to classify data into sectors or categories, which could be particularly useful in financial or market analysis.

embedding_models.py
Contains definitions and implementations of various embedding models, potentially including training procedures and utilities for loading and saving models.

base_model.py
This script defines the base model structure used across various machine learning models in the project, including common methods and utilities.

pointwise_context.py
Provides utilities for handling pointwise context in data analysis, particularly for enhancing model input with additional context-based features.
